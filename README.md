# Tachiyomi Extensions

This repo contains some open source (as well as a few closed-source) anime
and manga-related apps I found, downloaded directly from github (or the main
website, in the case of cylonu87's apps). This repository was split off from
[my main tachiyomi-extensions repo](https://github.com/efreak/tachiyomi-extensions);
the tachiyomi forks and extensions are still located there.

# Updating
If I don't update fast enough for you and you'd like to take over the work, let
me know and I'll give you the config.py and the keyfile and such. The script
I use to update is [update.sh](fdroid/update.sh).
