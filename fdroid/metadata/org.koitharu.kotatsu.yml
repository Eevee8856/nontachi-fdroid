Summary: Kotatsu is a free and open source manga reader for Android
Description: |-
    Note: I have not bothered with antifeatures in this app. Assume no ads (based on description only), but also assume tracking and upstream-nonfree, since I'm not bothering to check.

    Note: This app seems to be under active development. Don't expect me to update the description, because I won't. Click the source code link to see if it's accurate.
