Name: Nekos
Summary: Nekos - Search, Download and Share catgirls
Description: |-
    Note: I have not bothered with antifeatures in this app. Start using it assuming ads, tracking and upstream-nonfree, since I'm not bothering to check. It is listed on google play, if that matters to you.

    Nekos implements the nekos.moe api making all the high-quality images easily accessible on your mobile device, lovely neko/catgirl images and anything with animal-like features. It has features like logging in with your account, liking, favoriting, uploading images, downloading images and sharing images. It's time to fill your phones memory with cute catgirls.
